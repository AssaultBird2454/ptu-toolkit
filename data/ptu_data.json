Brightened auras can reflect good moods and intentions, whereas darkened auras can reflect a sour mood or deceptive and negative intentions.",

These may be no more than half a meter in any dimension and produce no sensory sensations outside of sight. Any physical contact noticeably disrupts an Illusion, and all other effects that see through Illusions can do so. Otherwise, the Illusion appears life-like and can be made to move, though it cannot move further than the user's Focus Rank in meters away from the user. Actively manipulating the Illusion requires constant attention from the user. For minor effects such as making an illusionary flame dance, this requires the user to constantly spend its Swift Actions. For more major effects such as animating an illusionary skeleton, the user must constantly spend Standard Actions. If a Pokémon gains the Illusion Ability and does not have the Illusionist Capability, they gain Illusionist.",
			"Inflatable": "A Pokémon with the capability Inflatable can expand its size up to 125% of its normal size as a Standard Action. While Inflated, a Pokémon does not change its weight.

			"Letter Press": "Unown with the Letter Press capability may be combined with other Unown, creating a Prime Unown, or adding to an existing Prime Unown. The first four times you add an Unown to a Prime Unown, including the creation of the Prime Unown, add 5 points to any one of the Prime Unown's Base stats. Combined Unown may retain different instances of Hidden Power from each individual Unown, up the normal Move List limit. When combining Unown with the Letter Press capability, for each instance of Hidden Power, choose whether it will operate on Attack stat or Special Attack stat. This choice is permanent. Unowns combined with Letter Press can be kept in a single Poké Ball, essentially becoming a single Pokémon. Once combined with Letter Press, Unowns cannot be separated. Prime Unown lose the Underdog Capability.",
			"Living Weapon": "In addition to being a Pokémon, Honedge and its evolutionary relatives also count as equipment and may be used as such if the Pokémon is willing. Honedge may be used as a Small Melee Weapon. Doublade may be used as two Small Melee Weapons; when one is held in each hand, the user gains +2 to Evasion. Aegislash may be used as a Small Melee Weapon and a Light Shield. When Fainted, these Pokémon may still be used as inanimate pieces of equipment, but all rolls made with them take a -2 penalty.\nIf the Living Weapon is also being used as an active Pokémon, the Wielder and the Living Weapon use the Wielder's Movement Speed to shift during each of their turns, and the total amount Shifted during the round cannot exceed the Wielder's Movement Speed.\nWhile wielded, the Living Weapon may impart its wielder benefits as if it were a Simple or Fine Weapon, as long as the wielder has the requisite Combat Skill Rank. A Honedge counts as a Simple Weapon and grants the Adept Move Wounding Strike. A Doublade counts as a Simple Weapon and Grants the Adept Move Double Swipe. An Aegislash counts as a Fine Weapon and grants the Adept Move Wounding Strike and the Master Move Bleed!. While used as a Living Weapon, the Pokémon also adds these Moves to its own Move List, so long as their wielder qualifies to access them.\nEither the Living Weapon or the Wielder can disengage as a Swift Action during their turn to Shift and attack separately. Re-engaging is a Standard Action that may be taken by either party. While Wielded, a Living Weapon cannot benefit from its No Guard Ability, and an Aegislash is automatically in Blade forme.",
			"Magnetic": "Magnetic Pokémon can lightly manipulate magnetic fields. With this, they can repel or attract iron and/or steel, holding it to their body or pushing it away.

			"Marsupial": "Kangaskhan is always born with the Baby Template (see Optional Rules), subtracting 5 from each of its Base Stats. While Kangaskhan have the Baby Template, they live in their mother's pouch and will not willingly leave it for long; their bond is so strong, that both Pokémon are able to be captured in a single Pokeball during this time. While Kangaskhan has the Baby Template, it cannot be Commanded to fight or take any action. Mother Kangaskhan with a Baby in their pouch are exceptional at protecting their babies; attacks cannot target Kangaskhan inside their mother's pouch while she is conscious. Trainers raising a Kangaskhan may choose to have their Mother Kangaskhan gain 20% less experience from any sources and give that Experience to the baby instead. Once a Baby Kangaskhan reaches level 25 and loses the Baby Template, it exits its mother's pouch permanently. If its mother had a loyalty higher than 1, it will allow itself to be easily caught by its Trainer.",

Feel free to adjust which Pokémon can be ridden as fits your campaign.",
			"Mushroom Harvest": "Pokémon of at least Level 20 with this Capability can produce a mushroom item once a day as an Extended Action. Roll 1d20 when this Capability is used.

			"Pack Mon": "A Pokémon with Pack Mon instinctively belong to a rigid pack structure, and are naturally inclined to the top of that structure. Wild Pokémon that are of this Pokémon's unevolved form or at least 10 levels lower than the user will instantly obey the user's commands; showing a Pokémon with Pack Mon to a group of Wilds will put them at a Fearful disposition. However, two Pack Mons of the same species and within 10 Levels of each other will fight for dominance of the group. If a Wild Pack Leader is ten levels higher than your Pokémon, it will expect your Pokémon to obey it, and may attack if it does not.",
			"Pearl Creation": "When a Pokémon with this Capability Evolves, it loses this Capability and creates a Pink Pearl Held Item.",
			"Phasing": "A Pokémon with Phasing may Shift through Slow Terrain without their Speed Capabilities being affected. As a Standard action, they may turn completely Intangible. While Intangible, they cannot be targeted by Moves or attacks, cannot perform Standard Actions, and lose a Tick of Hit Points at the end of each round. While Intangible, they may pass through solid walls and all other blocking terrain during their Shift Action. Becoming Tangible again is a Shift Action.",
			"Planter": "Pokémon with the Planter Capability can act as a Portable Grower, holding one plant at a time. Pokémon with this Capability may be limited in what they can grow. In these cases, they will have parentheses on their Planter Capability denoting what they can grow. For example, Planter (Berries) would allow the Pokémon to grow Berry plants only.",
			"Premonition": "Pokémon with this Capability have a supernatural sense for natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. The magnitude of the impending disaster and its proximity to the Pokémon both affect how often they get this sense before a disaster and how long in advance the warning is. Closer and bigger disasters tend to have a greater effect and may alert the Pokémon to the specific area where a disaster will occur days in advance, while lesser disasters may simply give the Pokémon an odd sense of unease several hours before they hit.",
			"Reach": "A Pokémon with Reach has the Range of their Melee attacks increased based on their size category; Small and Medium Pokémon may make Melee attacks from up to 2 meters away, and Large and bigger Pokémon may make Melee attacks from up to 3 meters away. Pokémon with Reach are either really large or have a stretchy limb with which they can strike foes from a distance.",
			"Shadow Meld": "Gengar can melt into shadows to remain unseen as a Standard Action. While doing so, Gengar receives a +4 bonus to Stealth rolls, gains +1 to its evasion, and can travel along a surface as if completely flat.

			"Shapeshifter": "Pokémon with this Capability can change their shape at will, taking on different forms as a Standard Action. When using this Capability, the user cannot increase or decrease its total mass by more than 50%, and they cannot replicate complex machines such as computers or phones. They may take on the appearance of these devices, but they will appear simplified in comparison. They can, however, transform into other moving forms such as acting as someone's prosthetic limb, a living lever or pulley system, or a Pokémon comparable in size. Note in this last case that the Shapeshifter doesn't gain any qualities of that Pokémon without actually using the Move Transform! Anyone closely examining a Shapeshifter Pokémon may determine its true nature with a Perception Check opposed by the Pokémon's Stealth. If a Pokémon learns the Move Transform and does not have the Shapeshifter Capability, they gain Shapeshifter.",
			"Shrinkable": "A Pokémon with the capability Shrinkable can shrink its size up to 25% of its normal size as a Standard Action, but this does not change its weight. While Shrunken, a Pokémon may not perform Standard Actions except to return to normal size, and gains a +4 bonus to Evasion. Using Shrinkable is not the same as using the Move Minimize, but if a Pokémon learns the Move Minimize and does not have the Shrinkable Capability, they gain Shrinkable.",
			"Soulless": "Shedinja is a unique Pokémon. Its default Ability will always be Wonder Guard and Shedinja's Max Hit Points is always 1. You may not add to a Shedinja's Hit Point stat, and Shedinja may not have Temporary Hit Points. However, Shedinja can't die and never gains Injuries. Given an Extended Rest, Shedinja always recovers to 1 Hit Point regardless of natural healing rate and how many Hit Points it had previously.",

			"Sprouter": "Once per week, Pokémon with the Sprouter capability can rapidly influence the growth of plants and flora around them. As a Standard Action, they may cause a plant around them to bloom, and potentially grow up to 1 meter in any direction. Sprouter may cause planted Berries to instantly give yield.",
			"Stealth": "A Pokémon with the Stealth Capability are excellent at approaching the enemy for an up close assault. While Shifting, unless they purposely want to, Stealth Pokémon do not make any noise. Unless a Pokémon with Stealth has used a Ranged Move during the current round or the round previous, Ranged Moves may not target them if the line of sight drawn goes through Rough Terrain or if the Pokémon is on Rough Terrain.",
			"Telekinetic": "Telekinetic Pokémon and Trainers can move objects with their mind. They can lift things with Telekinesis as if they were using a Power Capability equal to their Focus Rank. When lifting Staggering Weights with Telekinesis, they roll Focus instead of Athletics, and the DC is 10 instead of 4. They can target objects up to 8 meters away. Count the combined weight of all objects when determining whether they can lift all of them. Using this Capability to lift the user's Drag Weight or greater leaves discoverable psychic residue. Additionally, the user may use Struggle Attacks at a range of X, where X is the user's Focus Rank. These Struggle Attacks deal Normal-Type Damage as usual, but the user may add their Special Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. The user may perform the Disarm, Trip, and Push Maneuvers at the range of your Telekinetic Capability and using the Focus Skill for all opposed rolls. When the Push Maneuver is used this way, the user does not repeat the Push but instead Pushes the target a number of meters equal to half their Focus Rank. If a Pokémon learns the Move Psychic or Telekinesis and does not have the Telekinetic Capability, they gain Telekinetic.",
			"Telepath": "A Telepathic Pokémon can read the surface thoughts of people and other Pokémon X meters away where X is Focus Rank doubled. Pokémon with Telepathy can project their thoughts to the minds of other Trainers or Pokémon with Telepathy. Trainers with Telepathy can project their thoughts to the minds of any Trainer or Pokémon. Telepathy can be used to read only one target at a time but can project to on a number of separate targets at once equal to half the user's Focus Rank. Telepathy may be used to read minds with or without making the target aware of the attempt. Unwilling targets and targets that are unaware automatically resist the Telepathy attempt; the user and target roll opposed Focus Checks to determine if the Telepathy attempt is successful. A failure imposes a cumulative -3 penalty to future checks to use Telepathy on that target for the next 24 hours. Using Telepathy on an Unwilling target leaves discoverable psychic residue.",
			"Threaded": "Pokémon with the Threaded Capability may make a Threaded Shift as a Shift Action. A Threaded Shift is when a Pokémon targets an object and shoots a strong, thin line of silk, or extends a vine from themselves, and then quickly retracts that silk, or vine, pulling itself towards the object if the Pokémon is lighter than the object, or pulling the object towards the Pokémon if it is lighter than the user. Threaded has a range of 4 meters. If you target an unwilling Pokémon or Trainer with threaded, Threaded requires an AC 6 Status Attack to use. If a Pokémon learns the Move Spider Web, String Shot, Vine Whip or Power Whip and does not have the Threaded Capability, they gain Threaded.",

If the Pokémon has smelt whom they want to track in the past day, or one of their personal belongings, they can pursue that prey with a Perception check of 8 or better. To pick-up a random scent from nothing, a Perception check of 14 or better will allow the Pokémon to follow that scent. To pick-up a specific scent from nothing, a Perception check of 20 will allow the Pokémon to follow that scent. A Pokémon may only make these checks once per hour.

			"Illusionist": "Pokémon with the Illusionist Capability can create minor visual Illusions as a Standard Action. These may be no more than half a meter in any dimension and produce no sensory sensations outside of sight. Any physical contact noticeably disrupts an Illusion, and all other effects that see through Illusions can do so. Otherwise, the Illusion appears life-like and can be made to move, though it cannot move further than the user's Focus Rank in meters away from the user. Actively manipulating the Illusion requires constant attention from the user. For minor effects such as making an illusionary flame dance, this requires the user to constantly spend its Swift Actions. For more major effects such as animating an illusionary skeleton, the user must constantly spend Standard Actions. If a Pokémon gains the Illusion Ability and does not have the Illusionist Capability, they gain Illusionist.",
			"Inflatable": "A Pokémon with the capability Inflatable can expand its size up to 125% of its normal size as a Standard Action. While Inflated, a Pokémon does not change its weight.

The first four times you add an Unown to a Prime Unown, including the creation of the Prime Unown, add 5 points to any one of the Prime Unown's Base stats. Combined Unown may retain different instances of Hidden Power from each individual Unown, up the normal Move List limit. When combining Unown with the Letter Press capability, for each instance of Hidden Power, choose whether it will operate on Attack stat or Special Attack stat. This choice is permanent. Unowns combined with Letter Press can be kept in a single Poké Ball, essentially becoming a single Pokémon. Once combined with Letter Press, Unowns cannot be separated. Prime Unown lose the Underdog Capability.",
			"Living Weapon": "In addition to being a Pokémon, Honedge and its evolutionary relatives also count as equipment and may be used as such if the Pokémon is willing. Honedge may be used as a Small Melee Weapon. Doublade may be used as two Small Melee Weapons; when one is held in each hand, the user gains +2 to Evasion. Aegislash may be used as a Small Melee Weapon and a Light Shield. When Fainted, these Pokémon may still be used as inanimate pieces of equipment, but all rolls made with them take a -2 penalty.\nIf the Living Weapon is also being used as an active Pokémon, the Wielder and the Living Weapon use the Wielder's Movement Speed to shift during each of their turns, and the total amount Shifted during the round cannot exceed the Wielder's Movement Speed.\nWhile wielded, the Living Weapon may impart its wielder benefits as if it were a Simple or Fine Weapon, as long as the wielder has the requisite Combat Skill Rank. A Honedge counts as a Simple Weapon and grants the Adept Move Wounding Strike. A Doublade counts as a Simple Weapon and Grants the Adept Move Double Swipe. An Aegislash counts as a Fine Weapon and grants the Adept Move Wounding Strike and the Master Move Bleed!. While used as a Living Weapon, the Pokémon also adds these Moves to its own Move List, so long as their wielder qualifies to access them.\nEither the Living Weapon or the Wielder can disengage as a Swift Action during their turn to Shift and attack separately. Re-engaging is a Standard Action that may be taken by either party. While Wielded, a Living Weapon cannot benefit from its No Guard Ability, and an Aegislash is automatically in Blade forme.",
			"Magnetic": "Magnetic Pokémon can lightly manipulate magnetic fields. With this, they can repel or attract iron and/or steel, holding it to their body or pushing it away. Through this magnetic manipulation, they can also feel magnetic fields and discern magnetic north. If a Pokémon learns the Move Magnet Rise or Magnet Bomb, or gains the Magnet Pull Ability, and does not have the Magnetic Capability, they gain Magnetic.",
			"Marsupial": "Kangaskhan is always born with the Baby Template (see Optional Rules), subtracting 5 from each of its Base Stats. While Kangaskhan have the Baby Template, they live in their mother's pouch and will not willingly leave it for long; their bond is so strong, that both Pokémon are able to be captured in a single Pokeball during this time. While Kangaskhan has the Baby Template, it cannot be Commanded to fight or take any action. Mother Kangaskhan with a Baby in their pouch are exceptional at protecting their babies; attacks cannot target Kangaskhan inside their mother's pouch while she is conscious. Trainers raising a Kangaskhan may choose to have their Mother Kangaskhan gain 20% less experience from any sources and give that Experience to the baby instead. Once a Baby Kangaskhan reaches level 25 and loses the Baby Template, it exits its mother's pouch permanently. If its mother had a loyalty higher than 1, it will allow itself to be easily caught by its Trainer.",

Feel free to adjust which Pokémon can be ridden as fits your campaign.",
			"Mushroom Harvest": "Pokémon of at least Level 20 with this Capability can produce a mushroom item once a day as an Extended Action. Roll 1d20 when this Capability is used.

			"Pack Mon": "A Pokémon with Pack Mon instinctively belong to a rigid pack structure, and are naturally inclined to the top of that structure. Wild Pokémon that are of this Pokémon's unevolved form or at least 10 levels lower than the user will instantly obey the user's commands; showing a Pokémon with Pack Mon to a group of Wilds will put them at a Fearful disposition. However, two Pack Mons of the same species and within 10 Levels of each other will fight for dominance of the group. If a Wild Pack Leader is ten levels higher than your Pokémon, it will expect your Pokémon to obey it, and may attack if it does not.",
			"Pearl Creation": "When a Pokémon with this Capability Evolves, it loses this Capability and creates a Pink Pearl Held Item.",
			"Phasing": "A Pokémon with Phasing may Shift through Slow Terrain without their Speed Capabilities being affected. As a Standard action, they may turn completely Intangible. While Intangible, they cannot be targeted by Moves or attacks, cannot perform Standard Actions, and lose a Tick of Hit Points at the end of each round. While Intangible, they may pass through solid walls and all other blocking terrain during their Shift Action. Becoming Tangible again is a Shift Action.",
			"Planter": "Pokémon with the Planter Capability can act as a Portable Grower, holding one plant at a time. Pokémon with this Capability may be limited in what they can grow. In these cases, they will have parentheses on their Planter Capability denoting what they can grow. For example, Planter (Berries) would allow the Pokémon to grow Berry plants only.",
			"Premonition": "Pokémon with this Capability have a supernatural sense for natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. The magnitude of the impending disaster and its proximity to the Pokémon both affect how often they get this sense before a disaster and how long in advance the warning is. Closer and bigger disasters tend to have a greater effect and may alert the Pokémon to the specific area where a disaster will occur days in advance, while lesser disasters may simply give the Pokémon an odd sense of unease several hours before they hit.",
			"Reach": "A Pokémon with Reach has the Range of their Melee attacks increased based on their size category; Small and Medium Pokémon may make Melee attacks from up to 2 meters away, and Large and bigger Pokémon may make Melee attacks from up to 3 meters away. Pokémon with Reach are either really large or have a stretchy limb with which they can strike foes from a distance.",
			"Shadow Meld": "Gengar can melt into shadows to remain unseen as a Standard Action. While doing so, Gengar receives a +4 bonus to Stealth rolls, gains +1 to its evasion, and can travel along a surface as if completely flat.

			"Shapeshifter": "Pokémon with this Capability can change their shape at will, taking on different forms as a Standard Action. When using this Capability, the user cannot increase or decrease its total mass by more than 50%, and they cannot replicate complex machines such as computers or phones. They may take on the appearance of these devices, but they will appear simplified in comparison. They can, however, transform into other moving forms such as acting as someone's prosthetic limb, a living lever or pulley system, or a Pokémon comparable in size. Note in this last case that the Shapeshifter doesn't gain any qualities of that Pokémon without actually using the Move Transform! Anyone closely examining a Shapeshifter Pokémon may determine its true nature with a Perception Check opposed by the Pokémon's Stealth. If a Pokémon learns the Move Transform and does not have the Shapeshifter Capability, they gain Shapeshifter.",
			"Shrinkable": "A Pokémon with the capability Shrinkable can shrink its size up to 25% of its normal size as a Standard Action, but this does not change its weight. While Shrunken, a Pokémon may not perform Standard Actions except to return to normal size, and gains a +4 bonus to Evasion. Using Shrinkable is not the same as using the Move Minimize, but if a Pokémon learns the Move Minimize and does not have the Shrinkable Capability, they gain Shrinkable.",
			"Soulless": "Shedinja is a unique Pokémon. Its default Ability will always be Wonder Guard and Shedinja's Max Hit Points is always 1. You may not add to a Shedinja's Hit Point stat, and Shedinja may not have Temporary Hit Points. However, Shedinja can't die and never gains Injuries. Given an Extended Rest, Shedinja always recovers to 1 Hit Point regardless of natural healing rate and how many Hit Points it had previously.",

			"Stealth": "A Pokémon with the Stealth Capability are excellent at approaching the enemy for an up close assault. While Shifting, unless they purposely want to, Stealth Pokémon do not make any noise. Unless a Pokémon with Stealth has used a Ranged Move during the current round or the round previous, Ranged Moves may not target them if the line of sight drawn goes through Rough Terrain or if the Pokémon is on Rough Terrain.",
			"Telekinetic": "Telekinetic Pokémon and Trainers can move objects with their mind. They can lift things with Telekinesis as if they were using a Power Capability equal to their Focus Rank. When lifting Staggering Weights with Telekinesis, they roll Focus instead of Athletics, and the DC is 10 instead of 4. They can target objects up to 8 meters away. Count the combined weight of all objects when determining whether they can lift all of them. Using this Capability to lift the user's Drag Weight or greater leaves discoverable psychic residue. Additionally, the user may use Struggle Attacks at a range of X, where X is the user's Focus Rank. These Struggle Attacks deal Normal-Type Damage as usual, but the user may add their Special Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. The user may perform the Disarm, Trip, and Push Maneuvers at the range of your Telekinetic Capability and using the Focus Skill for all opposed rolls. When the Push Maneuver is used this way, the user does not repeat the Push but instead Pushes the target a number of meters equal to half their Focus Rank. If a Pokémon learns the Move Psychic or Telekinesis and does not have the Telekinetic Capability, they gain Telekinetic.",
			"Telepath": "A Telepathic Pokémon can read the surface thoughts of people and other Pokémon X meters away where X is Focus Rank doubled.

Telepathy can be used to read only one target at a time but can project to on a number of separate targets at once equal to half the user's Focus Rank. Telepathy may be used to read minds with or without making the target aware of the attempt. Unwilling targets and targets that are unaware automatically resist the Telepathy attempt; the user and target roll opposed Focus Checks to determine if the Telepathy attempt is successful. A failure imposes a cumulative -3 penalty to future checks to use Telepathy on that target for the next 24 hours. Using Telepathy on an Unwilling target leaves discoverable psychic residue.",
			"Threaded": "Pokémon with the Threaded Capability may make a Threaded Shift as a Shift Action. A Threaded Shift is when a Pokémon targets an object and shoots a strong, thin line of silk, or extends a vine from themselves, and then quickly retracts that silk, or vine, pulling itself towards the object if the Pokémon is lighter than the object, or pulling the object towards the Pokémon if it is lighter than the user.

			"Wielder": "Pokémon with the Wielder Capability gain a +2 bonus to Disarming and cannot have their natural weapons disarmed or removed by moves such as Thief, Covet, Switcheroo, and Trick. Small Pokémon with this capability may additionally wield man-made Small Melee weapons, gaining all normal benefits. Medium and higher size category Pokémon may wield Large Melee weapons. These weapons occupy the Pokémon's Held Item slot when Wielded.

Objects seen through X-Ray vision are seen as white shapes and outlines without much detailed definition. The effectiveness of X-Ray Vision depends on the object's material.

Totally Blinded targets receive a -10 total Penalty to Accuracy Rolls, and cannot use Moves with Priority or as Interrupts. When making a Shift action, they must declare if they are moving Slowly or Quickly; moving Slowly restricts Movement as if Slowed.

If a Burned Target takes a Standard Action or is prevented from taking a Standard Action by an effect such as Sleep, Flinch, or Paralysis, they lose a Tick of Hit Points at the end of that turn.",
				"Frozen": "The target may not act on their turn and receives no bonuses from Evasion. At the end of each turn, the target may make a DC 16 Save Check to become cured. This DC is lowered to 11 for Fire-Type Pokémon, and Ice-Type Pokémon are immune to becoming Frozen. If a Frozen Target is hit by a Damaging Fire, Fighting, Rock, or Steel Attack, they are cured of the Frozen Condition. Save Checks to cure this condition receive a +4 Bonus in Sunny Weather, and a -2 Penalty in Hail.",
				"Paralysis": "A paralyzed user's Initiative is halved. Make a Save Check that succeeds on 11+ at start of the user's turn. On a succesful check the user may act normally, but on a failed check the following effects occur:\n- The user can only take a Standard OR Shift Action that round, but not both\n- The user is Vulnerable for 1 full round\n- The user cannot take attacks of opportunity for 1 full round",
				"Poisoned": "The target's Special Defense Value is lowered by 2 Combat Stages for the duration of the poison. Poison and Steel-Type Pokémon are immune to becoming Poisoned. If a Poisoned Target takes a Standard Action or is prevented from taking a Standard Action by an effect such as Sleep, Flinch, or Paralysis, they lose a Tick of Hit Points at the end of that turn. When Badly Poisoned, the afflicted instead loses 5 Hit Points; this amount is doubled each consecutive round (10, 20, 40, etc)."
			},
			"Volatile": {
				"Bad Sleep": "Whenever the user makes a Save Check to save against Sleep, they lose two ticks of Hit Points. Bad Sleep may only afflict Sleeping targets; if the target is cured of Sleep, they are also cured of Bad Sleep.",
				"Confused": "At the beginning of their turn, a confused target must roll a Save Check.\n» On a roll of 1-8, the confused target hits itself using a Typeless Physical Struggle Attack as a Standard Action and may take no other actions this turn. This attack automatically hits, and deals damage as if it's resisted 1 Step.\n» On a roll of 9-15, the target may act normally.\n» On a roll of 16 or higher, the target is cured of confusion.",
				"Cursed": "If a Cursed Target takes a Standard Action, they lose two ticks of Hit Points at the end of that turn.",
				"Disabled": "When the user gains the Disabled Affliction, a specific Move is specified. The user cannot use that Move as long as they remain Disabled. Pokémon or Trainers may have multiple instances of the Disabled Condition, each specifying a different Move.",
				"Rage": "While enraged, the target must use a Damaging Physical or Special Move or Struggle Attack. At the end of each turn, roll a DC15 Save Check; if they succeed, they are cured of Rage.",
				"Flinch": "Upon becoming Flinched, the user lowers their Initiative by 5 for the rest of the Scene and is Vulnerable for 1 full round. Multiple of instances of Flinch may stack; being switched out removes the Initiative-lowering effect. (Also yes, you can now Flinch people of a higher Initiative than yourself)",
				"Infatuation": "Infatuated users take a -5 penalty on all Damage Rolls that do not include their Crush as a target. For determining Damage Rolls that do include their Crush as a target, the Infatuated target's Attack and Special Attack are halved. The user is cured of Infatuation with a Save Check of 16+ made at end of turn.",
				"Sleep": "Sleeping Trainers and Pokémon receive no bonuses from Evasion, and cannot take actions except for Free and Swift Actions that would cure Sleep (ex: activating the Shed Skin Ability). At the end of the sleeper's turns, they may make a DC 16 Save Check to wake up. Whenever a Sleeping Pokémon takes Damage or loses life from an Attack, they wake up. This does not include loss of life from passive sources such as Poison or Burns, but active attacks and effects that cause Hit Point loss (such as being hit by the Press Feature, or Super Fang) would wake up their target. Sleeping targets cannot make Save Checks to be cured of Rage, Infatuation, or Confusion, but they also cannot hurt themselves in Confusion. Pokémon and Trainers may wake an adjacent ally as a Standard Action.",
				"Suppressed": "Suppressed users cannot use Moves with any Frequency other than \"At-Will\". Suppression always lasts 1 full round.",
				"Confusion": "Confused users cannot take Attacks of Opportunity. If a Confused user makes an Attack (even at- tacks without rolls), roll 1d2. On 1, after the attack is resolved, the user loses Hit Points equal to half their Attack Stat if the Move was Physical, half or their Special Attack Stat if the Move was Special, or two Ticks of Hit Poitns if the Move was a Status Move. The user is cured of Confusion with a Save of 16+ made at end of turn."
			},
			"Other": {
				"Fainted": "A Pokémon or Trainer that is at 0 Hit Points or lower is Fainted, or Knocked Out. A Fainted Pokémon or Trainer is unconscious due to injuries or other effects, and cannot use any Actions, Abilities, or Features unless the Feature or Ability specifically says otherwise. The \"Fainted\" Condition is removed only by specific items such as Revive, or by being brought up to a positive Hit Point count by healing Features or Moves such as Wish or Heal Pulse. Potions and other healing items may still bring a Pokémon above 0 Hit Points, but it remains Fainted for another 10 minutes. When a Pokémon becomes Fainted, they are automatically cured of all Persistent and Volatile Status Conditions.",
				"Blindness": "Blindness represents the target's vision becoming obscured. A Blinded Pokémon or Trainer receives a -6 penalty to Accuracy Rolls, and must make an Acrobatics Check with a DC of 10 when traveling over Rough or Slow Terrain or become Tripped. Blindness is caused by several effects. This is in perpetual effect in deep darkness, unless the target has Blindsense or Darkvision. Pokémon or Trainers with Blindsense cannot be Blinded.",
				"Total Blindness": "Total Blindness is more than just obscured vision; it's total and complete sightlessness, such as experienced in a completely dark cave or building interior. Total Blindness has the same disadvantages as Blindness, and more. Totally Blinded Pokémon or Trainers have no awareness of the map, and must declare any shifts as distance relative to them. Totally Blinded targets receive a -10 total Penalty to Accuracy Rolls, and cannot use Moves with Priority or as Interrupts. When making a Shift action, they must declare if they are moving Slowly or Quickly; moving Slowly restricts Movement as if Slowed. Moving Quickly has no Movement Penalty, but if the user attempts to Shift into Blocking Terrain, Rough Terrain, or Slow Terrain, they become Tripped. Pokémon or Trainers with Blindesense cannot be Totally Blinded.",
				"Slowed": "A Pokémon that is Slowed has its Movement halved (minimum 1). This condition may be removed by switching, or at the end of a Scene as an Extended Action.",
				"Stuck": "A Pokémon or Trainer that is Stuck cannot make a Shift Action to move and cannot apply their Speed Evasion to attacks. This condition may be removed by switching, or at the end of an Scene as an Extended Action. Ghost Type Pokémon are immune to the Stuck Condition.",

				"Tripped": "A Pokémon or Trainer has been Tripped needs to spend a Shift Action getting up before they can take further actions.",
				"Vulnerable": "A Vulnerable Pokémon or Trainer cannot apply Evasion of any sort against attacks."
