# ptu-toolkit
Toolkit for Pokemon: Tabletop United

## About the Project
As a GM, I found that battling is one of the most time-consuming aspects of a PTU session. So, as an experienced programmer, I sought to solve this problem by automating it.

Introducing... The PTU Toolkit!

### The Mission
The main goal of this project is to make it open source. I want to make it so that if someone wants to do any kind of programming project for PTU-related things, they don't have to start from scratch. By making the platform web-based, anyone can make API calls to a RESTful HTTP server (translation: people can ask an internet spot for stuff).

## Contribution Rules
First things first, there are going to be a lot of people reading your code. While I don't want to sound like a stubborn Computer Science professor, I gotta say: **Readability is required!!!**

## Start Using It (alpha)
Right now, you can go ahead and get your hands on it to see what it will feel like, but it's not ready for you to use with your PTU group yet.
