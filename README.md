# ptu-toolkit
Toolkit for Pokemon: Tabletop United

## About the Project
As a GM, I found that battling is one of the most time-consuming aspects of a PTU session. So, as an experienced programmer, I sought to solve this problem by automating it.

Introducing... The PTU Toolkit!

### The Mission
The main goal of this project is to make it open source. I want to make it so that if someone wants to do any kind of programming project for PTU-related things, they don't have to start from scratch. By making the platform web-based, anyone can make API calls to a RESTful HTTP server (translation: people can ask an internet spot for stuff).

## Contribution Rules
First things first, there are going to be a lot of people reading your code. While I don't want to sound like a stubborn Computer Science professor, I gotta say: **Readability is required!!!**
