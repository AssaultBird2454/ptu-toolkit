First things first, there are going to be a lot of people reading your code. While I don't want to sound like a stubborn Computer Science professor, I gotta say: **Readability is required!!!**

* Code must be commented
* Proper indenting
* If you cannot complete the task that you took, that's totally okay! Just let me know.
